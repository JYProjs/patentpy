Release Info
------------
Current Version 0.2.0 changes:
 * refactored code for better maintainability
 * added progress bar
 * fixed bug where inappropriately coded chars in XML1 (2000-2002) files threw lxml parsing errors (bad characters replaced by ï¿½ symbol)
 * fixed bug where TXT (1976-2001) claims text incorporated char \'\\x9b\' (replaced with '!' to match ending '!', possibly control for brackets based on manual confirmation with uspto patent search results)
 * fixed spacing in TXT claims text

Version >= 0.1.1 supports both TXT and XML conversions of USPTO bulk patent data (Full Text - no images) to csv and dataframe format.
This includes patent data from January of 1976 to present.
